Analyzed key performance metrics, including total runs scored, average runs per match, and top-performing players across seasons.

Visualized trends and outcomes using bar charts, line graphs, and implemented filters for detailed analysis of specific teams, players, and seasons.

Calculated and displayed win-loss ratios for each team, offering deeper insights into team performance and trends over time.

Documented the project with a user guide for easy navigation and interpretation, transforming raw data into actionable insights for stakeholders.
